Changes for Device
    * Device is a new lower level abstraction that should encapsulate plaform
      specific as much possible.

    * Add device options to initialize or conduct platform specific functions.

    * Improve HCI device probing.(Thanks to @wolfeidau's contribution.)

Changes for Server (Peripheral Manager):

	* Advertising and services in databases are now decoupled.
	  User have more controls over which UUID or content they'd like to advertise.
	
	* Add iBeacon advertising API.

	* Add support for descriptors. Extend the handler mechanism from characteristic
	  to descriptor.

	* Add SetValue() for assiging static value for caracteristics and descriptors.

	* Export characteristic properties since they are used in clients.
 
    * Rework the original "handle" into "attr", which represent the attribute table.

    * Add Mac Port.
      Unlike acting as client, which seems more consisten across different platforms,
      acting as Peripheral on OSX has more descepency than on Linux.
      Core bluetooth abstracts device and exports convenient but also confined high
      level API for users. For example, it doesn't export the "connection" level, but
      "transaction" or "request" only. This is largely different from how we work
      with Linux on L2CAP connection. It doesn't provide disconnecting function.
      Advertising also has less flexible than we could provide on Linux.
      This is understood as it expect the user should be a good citizen sharing the
      resource with other apps. 

Changes for Client (Central Manager):

	The API favors synchronous flavor over asynchronous callbacks.
	After all, it's easy in go to turn sync to async with goroutine & channel.

Test:
	Test are left off in this commit, will catch up when the changes are more
	stable.

Thanks to: 
  @raff's [goble] for the XPC implementation. 
  @sandeepmistry's [noble] for referencing how core bluetooth works.
